## Big O Notation / Asymptotic Analysis
Big O Notation is used to describe the time complexity and space complexity of algorithms
It is understood to describe the worst case scenario of an algorithm

### Prerequisites
1. Time Complexity
 * This is a measure of how fast an algorithm runs
2. Space Complexity
 * This is the measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up

> How runtime of an algorithm grows as input grows

## Operations 
 * Constant O(1)
 * Logarithmic O(log(n))
 * Linear O(n)
 * Logarithmic O(n log n)
 * Quadratic O(n^2)
 * Cubic O(n^3)
 * Exponential O(2^n)
 * Factorial O(n!)
