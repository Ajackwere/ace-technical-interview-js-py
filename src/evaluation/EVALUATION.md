## Communication
 * Asks appropriate clarifying questions
 * Communicate approach, rationale and tradeoffs
 * Constantly communicating, even while coding
 * well organized, succint, clear communication

## Problem solving skills
 * Understand  the problem quickly by askinggood clarifying questions
 * Approach the problem systematically and logically
 * Able to come up with an optimized solution
 * Determine time and space complexity accurately
 * Did not require any major hints from the interviewer
 * Come up with multiple solutions
 * Explained trade-offs of each solution clearly and correctly, conclude which of them are most suitable for the current scenario
 * Had time to discuss follow up problems/ exxtensions

## Technical Competenccy
 * Translates discussed solution into working code with minimal to no bugs
 * Clean and straightforward implementation with no syntax errors and unnecessary code, good coding prctices e.g DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself), use proper abstractions
 * Neat coding style (proper indentation, spacing, variable naming, etc)
 * Compares several coding approaches
 * Demonstrates strong knowledge of language constructs and paradigms

 ## Testing
  * Came up with more tyical cases and tested teir code against it
  * Found and handled Constraints
  * Identified and self-corrected bugs in code
  * able to verify correctness of the code in a systematic manner(e.g acting like a debugger and stepping through each line, updating the program's state at each step)
