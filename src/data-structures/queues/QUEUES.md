# Queues
FIFO - First In First Out

A queue is implemented using a doubly linked list

### Why Linked Lists;
Adding and removing items is O(1) operation

### Why not Arrays
1. Arrays have indexex associated with them
2. Shifting indexes is O(n) operation linearly (quite expensive)

## Operations && complexities

| Lookup | enqueue | dequeue | peek |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:----:|
|  O(n)  |   O(1)  |   O(1)  | O(1) |

1. enqueue - add element to the last item
2. dequeue - remove the first element
3. peek - view the first item on the list
