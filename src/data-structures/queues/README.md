# Queues
> FIFO - First In First Out

Stacks can be used with Arrays or Linked List...

Why Linked Lists;
> Adding and removing items is O(1) operation

Why not Arrays
> Arrays have indexex associated with them
> shifting indexes is O(n) operation linearly (quite expensive)

## Complexities

### Time Complexity

| Lookup | enqueue | dequeue | peek |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|:----:|
|  O(n)  |   O(1)  |   O(1)  | O(1) |

> enqueue - add element to the last item
> dequeue - remove the first element
> Peek - view the first item on the list

### Space Complexity
