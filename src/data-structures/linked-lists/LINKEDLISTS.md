# Linked Lists
A **[linked List]()** is used to represent sequential data.<br>It is a data structure where each element is a separate object, called a [node](#node), that stores a reference  ([pointer](#pointer))to the next node in the list.<br>In js, linked lists can be implemented using objects and arrays.

### Pointer
This is a reference to another place memory

### Node 
This is a bucket of data

In order to access elements/nodes in a linked list, we have to traverse through all of the items sequentially just like arrays.<br>Linked lists are made of nodes. The node represented by value and a pointer commonly referred to as next. <br> A drawback of linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible.

## Types of Linked Lists
1. **Singly Linked List** : <br>Each node in the list contains a reference or a pointer to the the next node in the list. <br>The last node in the list (tail) contains a reference to null, indicating the end of the list. <br>The main disadvantage of this, is that you can only traverse the list in one direction, from the first node(head) to the last node(tail)
2. **Doubly Linked List** : <br> A doubly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, but in a ddition to a next reference(pointer), each node also has a prev pointer, which points to the previous node. <br>This allows for easier traversal in both directions and can be useful in certain types of algorithms 
3. **Circular Linked Lists** : <br> This is a variation of a singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node(head), forming a circular loop. <br>The main advantage of a circular linked list is that it allows for efficient implementation of certain algorithms such as traversing through a loop


### Time Complexity

| Access | Lookup | Insert(at) | Deletion |
|:------:|:------:|:----------:|:--------:|
|  O(n)  |  O(n)  |    O(1)    |   O(n)   |

Access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.


### **Basic Operations**
1. **Traverse**

    ```jsx
    procedure traverse_list(head)
      current = head
      while current != null
        print current.data
        current = current.next
    end procedure
    ```
  ```jsx
  Explanation
      Function takes in a parameter "head", which is the first node of the linked list
      Create a variable "current" and initialize it to the head of the list.
      Use a while loop to iterate throught the list, as long as "current" is not null (i.e. the end of the list has not been reached)
      Within the while loops, print the data stored in the current node using "current.data"
      Move the current pointer to the next node by assigning "current.next" to current and the loop continues
  ```

# Corner cases
* Empty linked list (head is null)
* Single node
* Two nodes
* Linked list has cycles.

![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=ðŸ’¡Tip:&color=orange): Clarify beforehand with the interviewer whether there can be a cycle in the list. Usually the answer is no and you don't have to handle it in the code
