# Linked Lists

A **linked List** is used to represent sequential data. Linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead each element contains an address of the next element eg: 10--->20--->35---> null. Each node contains: data, a reference(link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Pros

## Cons

A **Pointer** is a reference to another place memory
