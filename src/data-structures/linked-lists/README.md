# Linked Lists

A **linked List** is used to represent sequential data. Linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead each element contains an address of the next element eg: 10--->20--->35---> null. Each node contains: data, a reference(link) to the next node in the sequence.

## Pros

## Cons

A **Pointer** is a reference to another place memory

## Pseudocode for Basic Operations

//prepend
add elements at the beginning
//append
//lookup
//insertAt
//removeAt
//clear

# Corner cases

- Empty linked list (head is null)
- Single node
- Two nodes
- Linked list has cycles.
  Tip: Clarify beforehand with the interviewer whether there can be a cycle in the list. Usually the answer is no and you don't have to handle it in the code
