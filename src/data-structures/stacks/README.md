# Stacks

> LIFO - Last In First Out

Stacks can be used with Arrays or Linked List

Arrays allow cache locality, which make them technically fast when accessing itmes, Linked List have extra memory associated with them, because we have to hold on to the pointers

On the other hand, Linked List have more dynamic memory compared to Arrays.


## Complexities

### Time Complexity

| Lookup |  pop | push | peek |
|:------:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|  O(n)  | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |

> push - add element to the last item
> pop - remove the last element
> Peek - view the top most item

### Space Complexity

O(n)
