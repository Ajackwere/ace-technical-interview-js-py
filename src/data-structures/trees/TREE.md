# Trees
A Tree is composed of nodes, which can contain data, and edges, which connect the nodes. 
The root node is the starting point of the tree and branches off into other nodes. 
Each node can have one or more child nodes, which can in turn have their own children. This structure allows for efficient searching and sorting of data. 

All other nodes are connected to the root in some way. The nodes at the lowest level of the tree are called leaves. The nodes between the root and the leaves are called branches.

The tree data structure is an effective way to store and organize data. It allows for fast retrieval and manipulation of data, as well as efficient searching algorithms. Trees are commonly used to implement data structures such as binary search trees, heaps, and tries. Trees are also used in graph algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search.

The root node is the ancestor of all other nodes in the tree, and all other nodes are descendants of the root node. The root node is also the topmost node in a tree.

The depth of the root node is 0.
The height of the root node is the height of the tree.

## Types of Trees

**1. Binary Tree** 

**Binary Trees** are used to store and retrieve data in a fast and efficient manner. By organizing data in a Binary Tree, searching and retrieving data becomes easier as the tree structure allows for very fast access to data. Binary Trees are also used in sorting algorithms such as quicksort and heapsort.

**Binary tree conssist of pieces of data:**

  - The data or value stored in the node
  - A reference to the left child node
  - A reference to the right child node


**2. Binary Search Tree**
